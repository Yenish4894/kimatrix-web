# sena-temp — Frontend Flows Guide

> **Audience:** sena-temp frontend team (separate chat/repo).
> **Backend version at time of writing:** Phase 1-5 + structured address. Last updated 2026-05-03.
> **Status:** All flows described here are implemented and ready to integrate.

This document describes WHAT each user journey looks like end-to-end, so the frontend can build the right screens, in the right order, with the right data. For exact request/response shapes, see `FRONTEND_API_GUIDE.md`.

## What changed since 2026-04-17

- **(2026-05-03) Password reset emails are now actually delivered.** No FE change required — same generic 200 response, same `?token=...` URL format. Test by requesting a reset and checking the email inbox (instead of asking backend to grep server logs).
- **(2026-05-03) Conflict (`409`) error responses are now per-field friendly messages.** No change to response shape.
- **(2026-05-03) All rate limiters are Redis-backed.** No FE change — same headers, same 429 body.
- **BREAKING (2026-05-03) — Address split into 5 structured fields:** the single `address` string is gone everywhere. New fields: `streetAddress`, `city`, `state`, `country` (all required), `postalCode` (optional/nullable). Affects Flow 1 (Registration form), Flow 5 (Profile/Settings form), and any display surfaces (registration success, settings, admin company detail, future QR PDF poster). FE will use a country-state library (e.g. `country-state-city`) for Country and State dropdowns.
- **BREAKING — Flow 1 (Registration):** companies are now created in **pending** state. No tokens issued. User redirected to login page (not dashboard) and must wait for super admin to activate them. See updated Flow 1 below.
- **NEW — Flow 5 sub-flows:**
  - **Profile edit:** company can update address fields (each independently), contact email/phone, WhatsApp, promo opt-in via `PUT /api/company/profile`.
  - **CSV exports:** company can export all customers / all purchases via `GET /api/company/{customers,purchases}/export`.
- **NEW — Flow 8 (Password Change):** any authenticated user can change their password in-app via `POST /api/auth/password-change`.
- **NEW — Flow 7 (Super Admin):** companies now have **three states** — Pending, Active, Deactivated. Admin sees all three with appropriate actions per state.

## Brand & context

- **Working name:** sena-temp (internal)
- **User-facing brand:** KIMates
- **Target region:** Niger, West Africa
- **Target language (MVP):** English. French (i18n) layer reserved for later.
- **Currency:** not finalized (display the raw number + a currency label from the backend when provided).

## User roles

| Role | Where they live | How they sign in |
|---|---|---|
| **Super Admin** | Admin panel (separate UI) | `POST /api/auth/login` with email |
| **Company** (fuel station / shop owner) | Company dashboard | `POST /api/auth/login` with email or username |
| **Customer** (end user) | Public QR landing page | No login. Fills the form. |

## Global conventions

- **All requests/responses are JSON.** Content-Type: `application/json`.
- **Authenticated endpoints:** `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` header.
- **Standard success shape:** `{ success: true, message, data, timestamp }`
- **Standard error shape:** `{ success: false, message, error: "<CODE>", details?: [{ field, message }], requestId?, timestamp }`
- **Error codes to handle:** `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400), `BAD_REQUEST` (400), `UNAUTHORIZED` (401), `FORBIDDEN` (403), `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` (404), `RESOURCE_CONFLICT` (409), `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (429), `INTERNAL_ERROR` (500).
- **Request correlation:** every response carries `X-Request-Id` header. Log it client-side; include it in bug reports.
- **Rate limits:** when you get `429`, back off. The `Retry-After` header tells you when to retry.
- **Timestamps:** all timestamps are ISO-8601 strings (`2026-04-17T10:00:00.000Z`). Render in the user's local timezone.
- **Numeric money fields** (`totalInvoiceAmount`, `invoiceAmount`) come back as **strings** (e.g., `"5000.00"`) to preserve precision. Use a decimal-safe library (decimal.js, big.js) or display as-is.
- **UUIDs** everywhere for entity IDs. Never generate them client-side; always use what the server returns.
- **Phone numbers** must be in **E.164 format**: `+22712345678` (Niger country code +227). Validate client-side before sending.

## Flow 1 — Company Registration (pending activation)

**Purpose:** a new business (fuel station or shop) submits an application. The account is created in **pending** state and CANNOT log in until a super admin activates it (typically after manual payment verification).

**Screens (frontend):**
1. Landing / "Register your business"
2. Registration form (multi-step OR single page — backend doesn't care)
3. **"Pending activation" success screen** — instructs the user to wait for activation; provides a link back to the login page

**Fields to collect:**
- Company: name, registration number, contact email, contact phone, WhatsApp number (optional), business type (radio: Fuel Station | Shop)
- **Address (5 separate inputs):** Country, State/Region, City, Street Address, Postal Code (optional). Use a country/state library to populate Country and State dropdowns; the rest are free text.
- Account: username, email, password, confirm password
- Checkboxes: promo email opt-in (optional, defaults false), terms accepted (required, submit button disabled until checked)

**Validation rules (mirror server-side):**
- Email: valid format, max 255
- Username: 3-64 chars, `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]` only
- Password: 8-128 chars, must contain at least one lowercase + one uppercase + one digit
- Phone / WhatsApp: E.164 (`+[1-9]\d{1,14}`)
- Registration number: 3-128 chars, any characters
- `streetAddress`: 3-512 chars, required
- `city`, `state`, `country`: 2-128 chars, required
- `postalCode`: 1-32 chars, optional (`null`, empty, or omitted is fine — Niger and several West African markets don't use postal codes; do NOT block submit if empty)
- Terms accepted: MUST be `true`

**Address UX guidance:**
- Country: searchable dropdown populated from the npm library (e.g. `country-state-city`)
- State/Region: searchable dropdown filtered by selected Country
- City: free text (the libraries' city lists are inconsistent; don't block on dropdown)
- Street Address: textarea or single-line text input
- Postal Code: free text, optional. Show as "Postal/ZIP code (optional)"
- Send full names back to the API (`"Niger"`, not `"NE"`).

**Backend does:**
1. Validates input (Joi)
2. **Checks HIBP** — if password appears in known breaches, returns 400. Show the user: "This password has been leaked. Choose a different one."
3. Checks uniqueness of email, username, registrationNumber — returns 409 with `details` array showing which fields collided
4. Creates user (`isActive=true`) + company (`isActive=false`, pending) atomically
5. Returns: user + company (incl. `qrToken`). **No tokens are issued.**
6. Response message: `"Thank you for registering. Once your payment is verified, your account will be activated and you'll be able to log in."`

**Frontend should:**
- **DO NOT store any tokens** (none are returned in the response).
- Display the success message verbatim — instructs the user to wait for payment verification + activation.
- Provide a "Go to login" link / button that routes to the login page.
- Optionally: render the QR code on the success screen from the returned `qrToken` (constructed `${FRONTEND_BASE_URL}/qr/${qrToken}`) so the user can preview their QR. It won't be functional until activation.
- **Do NOT auto-login. Do NOT route to the dashboard.** The user has no valid session.

**Activation lifecycle (informational):**
- After registration → company is **Pending** (`isActive=false`, `deactivatedAt=null`)
- Super admin manually activates after off-platform payment verification → company becomes **Active**
- User can now log in normally

**Login attempts before activation:** the login endpoint returns the standard `401 UNAUTHORIZED "Invalid credentials"` (uniform error to prevent enumeration). Show the same message you'd show for a wrong password.

**Common error handling:**
- 400 VALIDATION_ERROR → inline per-field errors (use `error.details[]`)
- 400 BAD_REQUEST "password has appeared in a known data breach" → password field error
- 409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT → per-field collision messages
- 500 → generic "Something went wrong, please try again" + show `requestId` for support

## Flow 2 — Company Login

**Screens:** login page (email/username + password).

**Fields:**
- Identifier: email OR username (same field, single input)
- Password

**Behavior:**
- After success: store tokens, redirect to dashboard.
- **Rate limit:** 5 failed attempts per IP per minute. After that, 429 for 60s. Show the countdown if possible.

**Three error categories — render differently:**

| HTTP | When | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| `401 UNAUTHORIZED` "Invalid credentials" | Wrong email/username/password (or unknown user) | Generic UI: "Invalid email or password." Treat all 401s identically — anti-enumeration. |
| `403 FORBIDDEN` "Your account is awaiting activation. You'll be able to log in once your payment is verified." | Correct password, but company hasn't been activated by admin yet (typical for newly-registered users) | Show the backend message **verbatim**. Optional: add a "Contact support" link. |
| `403 FORBIDDEN` "Your account has been deactivated. Please contact support." | Correct password, but admin deactivated the company after activation | Show the backend message **verbatim**. |

The 403 messages are intentionally written as polished user copy — render them as-is in a banner or toast. Do NOT collapse them into the generic "Invalid credentials" UI; that was the bug the previous behavior had (newly-registered users had no idea why they couldn't log in).

**Why 403 is safe even though it reveals state:** the backend only reaches the state branch AFTER password verification. So the message only appears for someone who proved they own the account — no enumeration risk.

---

## Flow 3 — Password Reset

**Screens:**
1. "Forgot password?" — enter email
2. "Check your email" — always shown regardless of whether the email exists
3. Reset confirmation screen — user clicks email link with `?token=...`, enters new password + confirm

**Backend behavior:**
- Request endpoint **always returns 200** to prevent enumeration. Show the generic "If an account exists, a reset link has been sent" message — always.
- Confirm endpoint validates token, HIBP-checks new password, revokes all refresh tokens for that user. User must log in again after reset.
- Token TTL: 15 minutes. Show expiration to the user.

**Reset URL format:** `{FRONTEND_BASE_URL}/reset-password?token=<raw_token>`. The backend now actually delivers the email via SMTP (nodemailer + BullMQ-queued worker, branded HTML template). If the email queue or SMTP transport fails the API still returns its uniform 200 — the backend logs the failure and the user can re-request.

---

## Flow 4 — Token Lifecycle

**Tokens:**
- **Access token:** JWT, 24h TTL. Sent in `Authorization: Bearer` header on every authenticated request.
- **Refresh token:** opaque, 7d TTL. Sent ONLY to `/auth/refresh` and `/auth/logout` (in body).

**Rotation rules (security-critical):**
- Every successful `/auth/refresh` issues a **new** access + refresh token. The old refresh token is revoked.
- **If a revoked refresh token is presented, the backend revokes ALL refresh tokens for that user.** This is theft detection. The UI should treat this as "session ended, please log in again."
- On 401 from any endpoint, attempt exactly ONE refresh. If refresh also 401s, clear all tokens and redirect to login.

**Suggested frontend pattern:**
```
// Axios interceptor sketch
- On 401 → if not already refreshing:
    - Set refreshing = true
    - POST /auth/refresh with current refresh token
    - On success: update tokens, retry original request
    - On failure: clear tokens, redirect to /login
- On 429: honor Retry-After
```

**Logout:**
- POST `/auth/logout` with the current refresh token — marks that single refresh token revoked.
- Client-side: clear both tokens, redirect to /login.

## Flow 5 — Company Dashboard

**Screens:**
1. Dashboard home — stats cards + top spender + QR display
2. Customers list — paginated, searchable, sortable. **"Export CSV" button** → `GET /api/company/customers/export`.
3. Customer detail — name, mobile, vehicle (if fuel), totals
4. Purchases list — paginated, searchable, sortable, filter by customer, date range. **"Export CSV" button** → `GET /api/company/purchases/export`.
5. Purchase detail — invoice, amount, timestamp, ip/user-agent/location (for audit)
6. **Profile/settings — now editable.** `GET /api/company/profile` to view, `PUT /api/company/profile` to save changes. Editable: `streetAddress`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `postalCode`, `contactEmail`, `contactPhone`, `whatsappNumber`, `promoEmailOptIn`. Read-only: `name`, `registrationNumber`, `businessType`, `qrToken`, `joinedAt`, `isActive`. Address inputs use the same dropdown approach as registration. Each address sub-field is independently editable — the user can update just `city` without touching others. Also exposes "Change Password" — see Flow 8.

**Data relationships:**
- Customer has many Purchases
- Purchase belongs to Customer and Company
- Customer aggregates (`totalInvoiceAmount`, `submissionCount`, `lastSubmissionAt`) are pre-computed — don't recompute on the client
- Top spender = customer with highest `totalInvoiceAmount` per company

**UX rules:**
- All paginated lists: default page=1, limit=10, max limit=100
- Default sort for customers: `totalInvoiceAmount DESC` (top spenders first)
- Default sort for purchases: `submittedAt DESC` (newest first)
- Search: client sends raw string, server does ILIKE — debounce 300ms to avoid request spam

**QR display:**
- Profile response includes `qrToken` and `qrUrl`
- Render the QR image client-side from `qrUrl`
- Provide "Download as PDF" — generate client-side (jsPDF or similar) with QR + company name + address
- QR never changes for a given company. Print once, stick on wall.

---

## Flow 6 — Customer QR Purchase Submission (PUBLIC, no auth)

**This is the core product flow.** Customer at a fuel station/shop scans the printed QR code.

**Screens:**
1. QR landing — `/qr/:qrToken` (this page is loaded from the QR scan)
2. Form screen — fields depend on business type
3. Success screen — "Thank you!" + (if confirmed by client) total spend so far

**Flow:**
1. Page loads → call `GET /api/qr/:qrToken` to get `{ companyId, companyName, businessType, isActive }`
   - If `404` → show "QR code not recognized" error
   - If `isActive = false` → show "This business is not currently accepting submissions"
2. Render the form:
   - **All types:** Mobile (E.164 validated), Full Name, Invoice Number, Invoice Amount
   - **Fuel Station only:** Vehicle Number (REQUIRED)
   - **Shop only:** Vehicle Number field HIDDEN
3. Request browser geolocation permission (optional; user can decline). If granted, attach `latitude`, `longitude`, `locationAccuracy` to the submission.
4. Submit → `POST /api/qr/:qrToken/submit`

**Response 201 returns:**
- `purchaseId`, `customerId`
- `customerTotalInvoiceAmount` — their cumulative spend at this company (as a string)
- `customerSubmissionCount` — how many times they've submitted here
- `submittedAt`

**Display to user (confirmed MVP shape pending client):**
- Large "Thank you!" message
- Optional: "You've spent a total of X with this business." (tentative — confirm with client before shipping)

**Errors:**
- 400 VALIDATION_ERROR — field-level Joi errors, render inline
- 400 BAD_REQUEST (business type mismatch) — e.g., trying to submit a vehicle to a shop QR. Shouldn't happen if form renders correctly.
- 404 RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND — QR invalid
- 409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT — invoice number already used at this company. Show: "This receipt has already been recorded. You cannot submit the same invoice twice."
- 429 RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED — show the backend message verbatim. Three possible causes:
  - "You have reached the per-minute submission limit..." (10/min Redis limiter)
  - "You have reached today's submission limit for this number..." (50/day Redis limiter)
  - "You've already submitted a receipt at this business recently. Please wait about N more minute(s)..." (15-minute resubmit cooldown per `(company, mobile)`, vehicle-agnostic)

**Client-side UX details:**
- Mobile number input should have a country-code prefix locked to `+227` for Niger, but allow international numbers if the user types `+`.
- Vehicle number: uppercase on blur. Server also uppercases server-side.
- Invoice amount: allow decimal, max 2 places, max value = MAX_INVOICE_AMOUNT (ask backend; default 10,000,000). Show live validation.
- Invoice number: copy the number exactly as printed on the receipt.
- Full name: no strict format; trim on submit.

**Repeat customer UX:**
- First submission from a (mobile, vehicle) pair creates a customer record.
- Subsequent submissions: the customer's name / vehicle get updated to the latest values submitted.
- For same mobile but different vehicle at a fuel station → backend treats as two different customers.

## Flow 7 — Super Admin

**Screens:**
1. Admin login (same `/api/auth/login` endpoint)
2. Platform dashboard (stats cards: total companies, active, inactive, total customers, total spend)
3. Companies list (paginated, searchable, filter by status / business type) — **render the three-state badge per row** (see below)
4. Company detail (owner info, timestamps, status badge, action button per state)

**Three company states (most important UX detail):**

| Display | `isActive` | `deactivatedAt` | What it means | Admin action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🟡 **Pending** | `false` | `null` | Newly registered, awaiting payment verification | "Activate" button |
| 🟢 **Active** | `true` | (any value) | Operational | "Deactivate" button |
| 🔴 **Deactivated** | `false` | not `null` | Admin disabled the company after activation | "Activate" button |

The `GET /api/admin/companies` response always includes both `isActive` and `deactivatedAt`. The status filter (`?status=active|inactive`) does NOT distinguish pending vs deactivated — `inactive` returns both. If the admin wants to view only Pending, filter client-side: `isActive=false && deactivatedAt==null`.

**Recommended list UI:**
- Status badge column (3 colors)
- Action button column (`Activate` for pending/deactivated rows, `Deactivate` for active rows)
- Optional: a row of stats at top: `Pending: N | Active: M | Deactivated: K` (compute client-side from current page or call `GET /api/admin/stats`)

**Actions:**
- **Activate** (Pending → Active): calls `PATCH /api/admin/companies/:companyId/activate`. Typical workflow: admin verifies off-platform payment first, then clicks Activate. Show success toast: "Company activated. They can now log in."
- **Deactivate** (Active → Deactivated): confirmation modal first. Backend revokes the owner's refresh tokens → they're logged out everywhere. Show: "Company deactivated. Owner has been signed out of all devices."
- **Re-activate** (Deactivated → Active): same `PATCH /activate` endpoint. Owner must log in again (their tokens were revoked at deactivation).

**Boot-strap note:** the first super admin is created via a CLI script (`npm run seed:superadmin`). Frontend doesn't need to worry about this — it's a one-time backend setup step.

**Future:** when payment integration ships, the "Activate" action will move from manual click to webhook callback. Admin will still have manual override.

---

## Flow 8 — In-App Password Change (any authenticated user)

**Purpose:** logged-in user (company OR super admin) changes their password from the settings page, without going through the email-based reset flow.

**Screens:**
1. Settings page → "Change Password" section / button
2. Form: Current Password, New Password, Confirm New Password
3. Success → toast/banner + force-logout + redirect to login

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/password-change` (requires `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`)

**Backend does:**
1. Verifies `currentPassword` against the stored hash → 400 "Current password is incorrect" if wrong
2. HIBP-checks `newPassword` → 400 if compromised
3. Updates the password hash + `password_changed_at`
4. **Revokes ALL refresh tokens for this user** (every device is logged out)

**Frontend should:**
- After 200 response: show a brief success message ("Password changed. Please log in again.")
- Clear all stored tokens (access + refresh)
- Redirect to the login page

**Validation rules (mirror server-side):**
- Current password: 1-128 chars
- New password: 8-128 chars, must include lower + upper + digit
- Confirm new password: must equal new password

**Errors:**
- 400 VALIDATION_ERROR — Joi violations (mismatch, too short, missing complexity)
- 400 BAD_REQUEST "Current password is incorrect" → highlight the current-password field
- 400 BAD_REQUEST "...known data breach..." → highlight the new-password field, prompt for a different one

**Why force re-login:** standard hygiene. If the password change was triggered because of suspected compromise, an attacker may still hold valid refresh tokens elsewhere — invalidating them all closes the loop.

---

## Cross-cutting concerns

### Geolocation (Flow 6)
- W3C `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` — free, built-in, requires user consent.
- Timeout ~10s; if denied or timed out, submit without location (backend accepts nullable).
- In indoor fuel-station roofs, GPS accuracy can be poor; that's fine — send what you get.

### Offline / flaky network
- The QR submission endpoint isn't idempotent, but the DB enforces `UNIQUE(company_id, invoice_number)`. A retry of the same payload either succeeds (first time) or returns 409 (already recorded). Treat 409 on retry as "success, already saved."

### Language / i18n
- MVP is English-only. Store all UI strings in a translation file regardless, so French can be dropped in later.

### Pagination contract
- **Every in-app list endpoint is paginated** — `GET /api/admin/companies`, `GET /api/company/customers`, `GET /api/company/purchases`. Default `page=1, limit=10`, max `limit=100`. Response shape: `{ items, pagination: { total, page, limit, totalPages } }`.
- **Bulk-export endpoints are intentionally NOT paginated** — `/customers/export`, `/purchases/export`, and the future PDF reports return ALL records / a fixed-cap result. Trigger them as one-shot downloads.
- Rule of thumb: if you're rendering a scrollable/sortable/searchable table, the endpoint paginates. If the user is downloading a file, it doesn't.

### CORS
- Backend allows origin = `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` from env. Coordinate with backend ops on the production frontend origin.

### Request ID in error toasts
- Every error response has `requestId`. Show it in support-facing UIs: "Error (ID: abc-123...). Please include this code when contacting support."

## What's NOT in the backend yet

- **QR PDF download endpoint** — frontend generates PDF client-side for now. When backend adds async PDF via BullMQ, we'll expose `GET /api/company/qr/download-pdf` returning a job ID + an email-delivered link.
- **PDF reports** (all customers by spend, top 10) — same async pattern, pending. CSV exports of the same data ARE available now (`GET /api/company/customers/export`, `GET /api/company/purchases/export`).
- **Bulk email from super admin** — awaiting BullMQ email worker.
- ~~**Email delivery for password reset**~~ — **shipped 2026-05-03.** Reset emails are queued via BullMQ and sent via nodemailer SMTP. Backend env: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`.
- **Payment gateway / subscriptions** — client hasn't finalized. Activation is currently a manual super-admin step (Flow 1 + Flow 7). When the gateway lands, the payment webhook will replace the manual step.
- **Visitor analytics** — endpoint not yet built (`/admin/visitors`).

Ask backend team if any of these become blockers.
